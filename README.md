# Exploratory Data Analysis of Android Smartphone Prices

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Android smartphone data to understand how different hardware and software features influence product pricing.

The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, analyze feature distributions, and extract meaningful insights related to smartphone prices.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains specifications of Android smartphones including:
- Brand
- Processor family
- RAM and storage
- Camera specifications
- Battery capacity
- Display size
- Ratings and reviews
- Warranty information
- Price (target variable)

---

## 🛠️ Key Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values (categorical & numerical)
- Feature engineering (camera count, display size extraction, processor grouping)
- Outlier analysis
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Log transformation for skewed features (used only for visualization)
- Price relationship analysis with categorical and numerical features

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Snapdragon-based devices contribute the highest share to total price.
- Higher RAM, storage, and camera configurations are strongly associated with higher prices.
- Devices with expandable storage tend to have higher median prices.
- Larger display sizes and higher battery capacities correlate with premium pricing.
- Reviews and ratings show a skewed distribution, indicating popularity concentration among few devices.
